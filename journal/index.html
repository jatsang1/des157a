          by Amir Dori was a very insighful reading.This is especially because
          it comes from an expert in the game design industry. It felt like they
          were giving me the inside scoop on game design. They introduced me to
          design patterns found within the gaming genre of design, and gave tips
          on how to organize and utilize them in a game, which was very helpful
          to see. It would be a lie to say that I wasn't interested in game
          design. I actually came into college interested in learning about the
          process of creating concept art for games, especially for characters.
          It was the nerd inside of me trying to figure out. From the reading,
          I'm curious to read more about the playtesting, usability sessions,
          data, and reports that game designers utilize to provide the best
          experience for their player base, and compare how that process is
          similar or different to UI/UX testing I've learned.

        <h2>Log 4: Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <h3 id="part1">Part 1: My Image</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/fire.jpg" alt="fire" width="700" height="486" />
          <figcaption>---- Jason Tsang, 2022 ----</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I shot this image for my photography class last quarter. The state and
          color of the leaves indicate the autumn season. It was part of my
          final exhibition to demonstrate how far I've progressed in skill and
          visual understanding. I believed this photograph was worth writing
          about because it was one of the photos that received a lot of
          attention from my lineup.I was asked about the location, the time of
          day, and if the leaves were manually or digitally put. This was
          something I wanted to address in my archive/collection. The idea of my
          collection is to demonstrate how my knowledge of photography has
          improved over the last quarter. Before this, I only took pictures from
          my phone, but through trial and error I've come to learn how to use a
          camera. It's almost like a personal growth story, and I hope it
          inspires people to pick up a camera, or try something new.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 2: Partner's Image</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/karen.jpg" alt="karen" width="700" height="486" />
          <figcaption>---- Karen, 2023 ----</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="p2">
          Based on the arrangement of the figures in the image, I believe
          Karen's image depicts a group portrait with family and/or friends. The
          fact that everyone in the shot is gazing at the "lens" indicates that
          this was an intentional choice. The balanced heights of the
          individuals give a level of symmetry that generates a sense of unity.
          The arrangement of the figures offers the closeness and harmony that
          people seek in group photos. I think the most mysterious and curious
          aspect of this image is who the figures are and what the occasion is.
          My question is, who are these people and why are they together in this
          image?

        <h2>Log 3: Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Reading text can be tedious at times, especially if it's a wall of it
          or just ongoing pages. Like many people, I prefer to complete my tasks
          as swiftly as possible. Uninteresting or overly long readings might
          feel sluggish and time-consuming. It's like seeing a lecture with only
          slides with paragraphs and no graphics; it's overwhelming and
          difficult to remember anything. Some people learn better with
          pictures, and I believe that employing imagery to create a compelling
          learning environment has merit.

          highlights how educators are using photos to improve their students'
          observational and analytical skills. The educators accomplish this by
          showing photographs without captions on a regular basis and asking
          students to draw conclusions about the likely context/story behind
          them. To establish their findings, the students practice patience by
          paying attention to details in the image. They were able to pay
          attention to a subject, grasp it, and support their own judgments
          through increasing their visual thinking skills. This article
          demonstrates the significance and utility of visual aids in learning.
          I believe this may also be applied to how we show a design or website.
          Consider the website of
          <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a>. It offers a lot of
          interactive components and motion features that are controlled by the
          mouse. They show off their projects by having graphics surge towards
          the screen as you scroll. The visuals, like thumbnails, previews the
          content of the projects and entice the user to click on it for more
          information.

        <h2>Log 2: Overlay Design</h2>
        <p>
          The article
          <a

          by Naema Baskanderi discusses overlays and how to use them
          appropriately. This article helped me in putting a name to a design
          pattern I'd seen all over the internet. It was intriguing to learn
          that it has several names. Personally, I find this design pattern to
          be annoying at times, but I believe this is dependent on how the site
          designer employs it. One of the preventive measures offered by
          Baskanderi that I found very appealing was the user-initiated overlay.
          This is because I despise it when I'm going through a website and a
          popup window randomly appears. It's occurred so many times that I've
          learned to ignore overlays when they appear. However, I believe the
          design pattern has the potential to be effective if designers examine
          its advantages and regulate how it disrupts user flow.

        <h2>Log 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Completing a form isn't always the most enjoyable experience. At
          times, it can feel tedious or difficult to finish. Some people might
          find themselves abandoning a form, or switching to another task. As
          designers, it is important to take into consideration the usability of
          our forms because it affects the accessibility, attention, enjoyment,
          and success of them. The article
          <a

            >"Best practices for form design"</a
          >
          by Salim Ansari shares helpful protocols/tips to address this. Some
          examples that stood out to me was providing a clear visual of
          progression or how many steps are left as way to motivate form
          completion, and reduce the user's cognitive burden and visual noise by
          dividing a long form into seperate sections/steps.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          One website that I've interacted with that exemplifies some of these
          practices is
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duolingo</a>. They chunk
          their surveys, courses and language learning into a singular
          step-by-step process, and they provide a progress bar to let their
          users know the level of completion. By having these practices in
          place, the user is not overwhelmed by a load of information and is
          encouraged to stay on task.
