        <h2>Log 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Completing a form isn't always the most enjoyable experience. At
          times, it can feel tedious or difficult to finish. Some people might
          find themselves abandoning a form, or switching to another task. As
          designers, it is important to take into consideration the usability of
          our forms because it affects the accessibility, attention, enjoyment,
          and success of them. The article

          by Salim Ansari shares helpful protocols/tips to address this. Some
          examples that stood out to me was providing a clear visual of
          progression or how many steps are left as way to motivate form
          completion, and reduce the user's cognitive burden and visual noise by
          dividing a long form into seperate sections/steps.

          One website that I've interacted with that exemplifies some of these
          practices is
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duolingo</a>. They chunk
          their surveys, courses and language learning into a singular
          step-by-step process, and they provide a progress bar to let their
          users know the level of completion. By having these practices in
          place, the user is not overwhelmed by a load of information and is
          encouraged to stay on task.
