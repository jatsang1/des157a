        <h2>Log 3: Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Reading text can be tedious at times, especially if it's a wall of it
          or just ongoing pages. Like many people, I prefer to complete my tasks
          as swiftly as possible. Uninteresting or overly long readings might
          feel sluggish and time-consuming. It's like seeing a lecture with only
          slides with paragraphs and no graphics; it's overwhelming and
          difficult to remember anything. Some people learn better with
          pictures, and I believe that employing imagery to create a compelling
          learning environment has merit. Michael Gonchar's article
          <a
            href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"
            >"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual
            Thinking Skills"</a
          >
          highlights how educators are using photos to improve their students'
          observational and analytical skills. The educators accomplish this by
          showing photographs without captions on a regular basis and asking
          students to draw conclusions about the likely context/story behind
          them. To establish their findings, the students practice patience by
          paying attention to details in the image. They were able to pay
          attention to a subject, grasp it, and support their own judgments
          through increasing their visual thinking skills. This article
          demonstrates the significance and utility of visual aids in learning.
          I believe this may also be applied to how we show a design or website.
          Consider the website of
          <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a>. It offers a lot of
          interactive components and motion features that are controlled by the
          mouse. They show off their projects by having graphics surge towards
          the screen as you scroll. The visuals, like thumbnails, previews the
          content of the projects and entice the user to click on it for more
          information.

        <h2>Log 2: Overlay Design</h2>
        <p>
          The article
          <a
            href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"

          by Naema Baskanderi discusses overlays and how to use them
          appropriately. This article helped me in putting a name to a design
          pattern I'd seen all over the internet. It was intriguing to learn
          that it has several names. Personally, I find this design pattern to
          be annoying at times, but I believe this is dependent on how the site
          designer employs it. One of the preventive measures offered by
          Baskanderi that I found very appealing was the user-initiated overlay.
          This is because I despise it when I'm going through a website and a
          popup window randomly appears. It's occurred so many times that I've
          learned to ignore overlays when they appear. However, I believe the
          design pattern has the potential to be effective if designers examine
          its advantages and regulate how it disrupts user flow.

        <h2>Log 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Completing a form isn't always the most enjoyable experience. At
          times, it can feel tedious or difficult to finish. Some people might
          find themselves abandoning a form, or switching to another task. As
          designers, it is important to take into consideration the usability of
          our forms because it affects the accessibility, attention, enjoyment,
          and success of them. The article
          <a

          >
          by Salim Ansari shares helpful protocols/tips to address this. Some
          examples that stood out to me was providing a clear visual of
          progression or how many steps are left as way to motivate form
          completion, and reduce the user's cognitive burden and visual noise by
          dividing a long form into seperate sections/steps.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          One website that I've interacted with that exemplifies some of these
          practices is
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duolingo</a>. They chunk
          their surveys, courses and language learning into a singular
          step-by-step process, and they provide a progress bar to let their
          users know the level of completion. By having these practices in
          place, the user is not overwhelmed by a load of information and is
          encouraged to stay on task.
