          by Naema Baskanderi discusses overlays and how to use them
          appropriately. This article helped me in putting a name to a design
          pattern I'd seen all over the internet. It was intriguing to learn
          that it has several names. Personally, I find this design pattern to
          be annoying at times, but I believe this is dependent on how the site
          designer employs it. One of the preventive measures offered by
          Baskanderi that I found very appealing was the user-initiated overlay.
          This is because I despise it when I'm going through a website and a
          popup window appears. It's occurred so many times that I've learned to
          ignore overlays when they appear. However, I believe the design
          pattern has the potential to be effective if designers examine its
          advantages and regulate how it disrupts user flow.

        <h2>Log 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Completing a form isn't always the most enjoyable experience. At
          times, it can feel tedious or difficult to finish. Some people might
          find themselves abandoning a form, or switching to another task. As
          designers, it is important to take into consideration the usability of
          our forms because it affects the accessibility, attention, enjoyment,
          and success of them. The article

          by Salim Ansari shares helpful protocols/tips to address this. Some
          examples that stood out to me was providing a clear visual of
          progression or how many steps are left as way to motivate form
          completion, and reduce the user's cognitive burden and visual noise by
          dividing a long form into seperate sections/steps.

        <p class="p2">
          One website that I've interacted with that exemplifies some of these
          practices is
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duolingo</a>. They chunk
          their surveys, courses and language learning into a singular
          step-by-step process, and they provide a progress bar to let their
          users know the level of completion. By having these practices in
          place, the user is not overwhelmed by a load of information and is
          encouraged to stay on task.
