            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>For my final, I plan on updating my Mad-Libs studio project on Pokémon by adding sound, creating character graphics, and rethinking the layout. </p>

                <h3>[Project Goals]</h3>
                <p>The overall goal for this final project is to improve my Mad-Libs studio, or build upon the Pokémon theme. This will be accomplished by completing smaller goals geared towards the project. First, I want to create more of a story/narrative, inspired by the Every Picture studio. Second, I want to include sound and music for the ambience and feedback, inspired by the GameOn! Studio. Third, I want to create visuals for the output that I could not previously do. Finally, I also want to take into account the overall feedback I received from my peers for all the studios.</p>

                <h3>[Design Strategies]</h3>
                <p>My plan for the overall look and feel of the project is to follow the Pokémon theme in order to create a visual connection to the franchise. This includes colors that are associated with the brand such as red, blue, black, gray, and white. These colors reference the Pokeball, the device used to capture the creatures. I will be using the Press Start 2P font because it is the closest match (on Google Fonts) I can find that is reminiscent of the early games. Feel free to suggest any arcade/pixel-like fonts. In conjunction with the color scheme, I plan on creating a visual hierarchy with this font by contrasting it with Montserrat, and different text size and weight.

                <h3>[Interaction Strategies]</h3>
                <p>In terms of interaction, I will be following the basic layout of a MadLibs but combining it with the storyline of Pokémon. There will be Pokémon music playing in the background that the user can choose to mute. There will be a loading screen to let the user know when the page is fully loaded. The user will input simple but essential information for the MadLib narrative, such as their name, the name and type of their Pokémon, the region they live in, the name of their rival, and their final goal. The narrative will be illustrated and follow a linear timeline that the user can scroll through. Each section of the timeline will have its corresponding text and music.</p>

                <h3>[Experience Goals]</h3>
                <p>My intended/desired experience goals for the users is to have fun. I hope that users familiar with the Pokémon brand get a sense of nostalgia from the story. I hope those who aren’t familiar with it get a taste of how wonderful it is. I plan to achieve this by formatting the narrative to follow general milestones/events found in the game and show, and using audio. I will utilize user flows to keep track of how a user might interact with the project from start to finish. This will allow me to make necessary adjustments/corrections where needed.</p>
