                <h3>[#1 Form]</h3>
                <p>The users found the form to be easy and clear to fill out. The labels were not confusing, and the placement text helped the user fill out the fields quicker.</p>

                <h3>[#2 Dialogue]</h3>
                <p>The users found the dialogue to be easy to understand and cohesive. It was especially helpful to see the inputted text being highligthed so that they could see what part they played in the story. The line-height made it feel compact. One thing is that some users would like some indicator of who is speaking, or of the setting.</p>

                <h3>[#3 Navigation]</h3>
                <p>The users breezed through the form, but had more difficulty with navigating the dialogue towards the end. On the third dialogue, the users were confused about what to do next because there was not a restart button, and the 'next' button didn't do anything new. Also, when looking for the 'next' button the users went all the way to the left side.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Plans</h2>
            <p>Based on the feedback and obervations, I plan to improve my dialogue and navigation for the final. I want to give the users more options to go back, restart, and go forward. I plan on keeping the click-through format as it coincides with the game pattern of pressing button for an action. As the dialogue progresses, one way to increase interaction is to have them fill out a new form when the situation calls for it, such as choosing/describing their starter pokémon, instead of having them fill everything out at the beginning. I also plan to include sound and (hopefully) visuals for each dialogue so that users get a sense of the setting.</p>
